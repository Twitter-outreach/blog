2. **Direct**: A clear call-to-action (CTA).

Keep messages **concise and engaging**. Offer different actions, such as setting up calls or joining a community. Avoid long, email-like messages.

### Action Items:
- Create short and effective DM templates.
- Use indirect or direct messaging depending on your campaign goals.

## Step 4: Campaign Execution and Scaling

Once your campaign is ready, set the **DM limit** and ensure the tool skips profiles you've already messaged. You can scale your efforts by checking the **resources section** for managing multiple accounts and campaigns.

### Action Items:
- Open 3-5 conversations to warm up the account.
- Execute the campaign with your set DM limit.
