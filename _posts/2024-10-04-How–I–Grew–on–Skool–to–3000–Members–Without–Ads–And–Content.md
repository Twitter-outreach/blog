In this tutorial, I’ll share how I grew my free school group on Skool to over 3,000 members without spending on ads or relying on a large audience. By utilizing cold direct messaging (DM) through multiple social media accounts, I consistently acquired 10-20 new members daily while nurturing their trust before converting them to a paid community.

## Growing a Free School Group
1. **Set Up Multiple Accounts**: I created several Instagram and Twitter (X) accounts to increase my outreach capabilities.
   
2. **Scrape Leads**: I targeted qualified individuals by scraping leads, ensuring my messages reached the right audience.

3. **Send DMs**: Using 5 accounts on X, I sent personalized DMs, inviting leads to join the group without incurring any ad costs.

## Strategy and Conversion
1. **Nurture New Members**: I focused on building trust with new members in the free group, paving the way for conversion to a paid community.

2. **Choose the Right Platform**: I targeted platforms where my audience was most active, considering their DM limits—X allowed for higher volumes compared to Instagram or Facebook.

## Numbers and Setup
1. **High Volume DMs on X**: I sent 450 DMs per day per account, totaling 2,250 DMs daily.

2. **Set Realistic Expectations**: I anticipated gaining 10-22 new members daily, leading to several sales calls.

## Messaging Strategy
1. **Target Specific Audiences**: My messaging targeted agency owners, showcasing the community’s value.

2. **Use a Message Template**: A clear, value-driven message helped engage potential members and create urgency with free offers.

## Scaling the Strategy
1. **Increase Accounts**: I scaled from 5 to 24 accounts to boost my daily outreach.

2. **Follow Up**: Consistent follow-ups with new members led to better engagement and conversion rates.

## Action Items
- Set up multiple social media accounts for outreach.
- Scrape and send daily DMs to targeted leads.
- Scale the number of accounts for greater outreach.
- Follow up and book sales calls to convert leads into paid members.

By implementing these strategies, you can grow a thriving community without relying on ads. Happy growing!
